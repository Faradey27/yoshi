# How do I analyze my webpack bundle contents

You can do one of the following:
- Go to https://chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer/
- Drag `target/webpack-stats.json` from your project and drop in browser page for analysis

Prefer doing analysis on `target/webpack-stats.json` using CLI? try https://github.com/robertknight/webpack-bundle-size-analyzer
